## What is Kaia? <a id="what-is-kaia"></a>

Kaia is the Layer 1 blockchain platform with low latency, high TPS and immediate finality. It is the optimal blockchain for building games and realizing the metaverse, supporting Ethereum Equivalence. It provides the comprehensive [Metaverse Package](https://metaverse-knowledge-kit.kaia.io/) to facilitate blockchain building experience. To better understand Kaia, please refer to our [Light Paper](https://klaytn.foundation/wp-content/themes/klaytn/download/lightpaper.pdf).

## How does Kaia support Ethereum equivalence? <a id="how-ethereum-equivalence"></a>

Kaia is EVM compatible, and supports all Ethereum London EVM features. Our `eth` namespace has been amended to be compatible with Ethereum’s. Ethereum toolings can be used seamlessly, and migration of Ethereum dApps have also become possible with minimal effort. Transaction types and fields are also equivalent to Ethereum’s.

## What is Kaia’s gas policy? <a id="kaia-gas-policy"></a>

Kaia transitioned from a fixed gas fee policy to adopt a dynamic gas fee mechanism in order to combat arbitrage bots. Please refer to this [article](https://medium.com/klaytn/dynamic-gas-fee-pricing-mechanism-1dac83d2689) for more information.

## What is special about Kaia’s account structure? <a id="kaia-account-structure"></a>

To provide maximum convenience for dApp developers, Kaia has devised a way to [decouple private keys from addresses](https://klaytn-tech.medium.com/klaytn-usability-improvement-series-1-separating-keys-and-addresses-dd5e367a0744). As a result, you can easily implement [multisig](https://medium.com/klaytn/klaytn-usability-improvement-series-2-introducing-multisig-on-the-platform-level-85141893db01), whereby you create multiple private keys for a single account, with each key having different weights. Each key can be assigned with [different roles](https://medium.com/klaytn/klaytn-usability-improvement-series-4-supporting-role-based-keys-on-the-platform-level-e2c912672b7b) as well.

## Where can I start dApp development with Kaia? <a id="dapp-development"></a>

Whether you are migrating from Ethereum, or building on Kaia from scratch, we support all the necessary tools and infrastructure. You can test your smart contracts on [Remix IDE](../build//tutorials/connecting-remix) using Kaia Plugin or connect to [MetaMask](../build/tutorials/connecting-metamask) wallet and [Kaia Wallet](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/kaia-wallet/jblndlipeogpafnldhgmapagcccfchpi). Kaia’s sdk `caver` is available as [caver-js](https://github.com/kaiachain/caver-js) You can refer to our [tutorials](../build/tutorials/tutorials.md) to try building a dApp on Kaia.

## Is Kaia Open Source? <a id="is-kaia-open-source"></a>

Kaia is most certainly open source! Take a look at our [Github Organisation](https://github.com/klaytn) and you can start [contributing](https://github.com/klaytn/klaytn-docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to our Kaia Documentation. Read more about our open-source policies [here](opensource).

## How can I initially fund my account? <a id="fund-my-acconut"></a>

You may purchase KAIA on the exchange. The list of available exchanges can be found here:
[Coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/klaytn/markets/) or [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/klay#markets)

## Any Kaia’s Public Node Providers for testing and development? <a id="node-providers"></a>

Refer to this [list](../references/public-en#public-json-rpc-endpoint-providers) for Kaia’s Public Node Providers and the network domains.

## Are there faucets to get test KAIA? <a id="are-there-faucets"></a>

You can get test KAIA for development and testing purposes here:
[Kaia Faucet](https://faucet.kaia.io)
[AllThatNode Faucet](https://www.allthatnode.com/faucet/klaytn.dsrv)
[NODIT Faucet](https://kaiafaucet.com)
[Thirdweb Faucet](https://thirdweb.com/kaia-testnet-kairos)

## How do I check for Public RPC endpoint status? <a id="rpc-endpoint-status"></a>

Since we cannot guarantee uptime and stability of the endpoints, you can always check for node provider status [here](https://www.allthatnode.com/klaytn.dsrv).

## Which wallets support Kaia? <a id="which-wallets"></a>

Kaia is supported by the cold wallet D’cent, as well as a host of hot wallets like Kaia Wallet, MetaMask and more. Please refer to the list [here](http://klaytn.foundation/ecosystem).

## What is Mainnet, what is Kairos? <a id="what-is-mainnet-what-is-kairos"></a>

Mainnet is the Kaia mainnet, Kairos is a testnet.
Below is information relating to each network.

Mainnet:

- EN download : Choose the Mainnet package from the [download page](../nodes/downloads/downloads.md).
- Kaiascope : https://kaiascope.com/

Kairos testnet:

- EN download : Choose the Kairos package from the [download page](../nodes/downloads/downloads.md).
- Kaiascope : https://kairos.kaiascope.com
- Kairos Faucet : https://faucet.kaia.io

## Are there any Kaia SDKs? In what languages? <a id="kaia-sdks"></a>

Official Kaia SDKs are provided in JavaScript and Java.
See [caver-js](../references/sdk/caver-js/caver-js.md) and [caver-java](../references/sdk/caver-java/caver-java.md). Community contributions are always welcome in providing [Kaia APIs](../../references/json-rpc/klay/account-created) in other languages.

To learn about how to build dApps using Kaia SDK, see [Tutorials](../build/tutorials/tutorials.md).

Also, check the porting guidelines [from web3.js](../references/sdk/caver-js-1.4.1/porting-from-web3.js.md) and [from web3j](../references/sdk/caver-java-1.4.0/porting-from-web3j.md). Because the syntactic of caver-js and caver-java are very similar to web3.js and web3j, porting should be minimal and very straightforward. But, no, you can not use web3.js or web3j to make a request against Kaia.

## Must I install and run an EN (Endpoint Node) to use Kaia? <a id="must-i-install-and-run-en"></a>

Yes and No.
Endpoint node validates the blocks and exposes RPC APIs to the outer world. EN is always needed for your application to interact with the Kaia network.
For those who simply want to try Kaia APIs, you can try [KAS (Kaia API Service)](https://www.klaytnapi.com).
KAS provides Kaia Node API service that exposes RPC APIs of Kaia networks (both Kairos and Mainnet) as well as other useful API services.
Note that KAS serves free API requests after user registration. For pricing plans, please refer to [KAS pricing page](https://www.klaytnapi.com/landing/pricing).

## I am running an EN, and node data sync is too slow. <a id="node-data-sync-is-too-slow"></a>

First, check if your HW specification meets the [system requirements](../nodes/endpoint-node/system-requirements.md).

Check the [fast sync](../nodes/endpoint-node/install-endpoint-nodes.md#fast-sync-optional).
Kaia publishes the chain data every day. Chain data is a database snapshot that stores all blocks generated since the genesis. Download the latest chain data for the fast sync.

## Can I use ERC-20 and ERC-721 contracts on Kaia? <a id="can-i-use-erc-20-and-erc-721"></a>

Yes. Kaia supports Solidity as a smart contract language. [ERC-20](../build/smart-contracts/samples/erc-20.md) and [ERC-721](../build/smart-contracts/samples/erc-721.md) written in Solidity for Etherem can be deployed and executed on Kaia.

Further Kaia-specific token standards can be defined. Follow the [KIP (Kaia Improvement Proposal)](http://kips.klaytn.foundation) and join the discussion.

## Can I use Truffle for the smart contract development on Kaia? <a id="can-i-use-truffle"></a>

Yes. Truffle can be used in developing smart contracts on Kaia with [truffle-hdwallet-provider-klaytn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/truffle-hdwallet-provider-klaytn).
See [Truffle](../build/smart-contracts/ide-and-tools/truffle.md) and follow the configuration guideline.

If you are new to Truffle, see [Testing Guide](../build/smart-contracts/testing-guide.md) and [Deployment Guide](../build/smart-contracts/deploy/deploy.md) to get a rough idea on what you can do with Truffle.

## Where can I get a browser extension wallet like Metamask? <a id="where-can-i-get-a-browser-extension-wallet"></a>

Kaia's web browser extension wallet [Kaia Wallet](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/kaia-wallet/jblndlipeogpafnldhgmapagcccfchpi). Kaia Wallet is a non-custodial wallet with which you can make KAIA transactions and create accounts.

## Why is my fee-payer account address not derived from the key provided? <a id="account-address-is-not-derived-from-the-key"></a>

In Kaia, [the account address can be decoupled from the key pair](../learn/accounts.md#decoupling-key-pairs-from-addresses).

Common use cases are as follows.

- The account owner wants to change the key for security reasons.
- The account has a weighted-multisig or a role-based key that allows having multiple key pairs to control the account.

Fee-payer accounts usually have a [role-based key](../learn/accounts.md#accountkeyrolebased). In most cases, the account address is not derived from the RoleFeePayer key.

## Where can I find complete working samples of fee-delegation? <a id="fee-delegation-samples"></a>

Check [fee-delegation-example](../build/tutorials/fee-delegation-example.md) to get a complete working code of value transfer.

See the [JavaScript code snippet](https://gist.github.com/w3kim/64a3cf5da58250474f046d4dd7f85cc8) for deploying a contract with fee-delegation. Note that you can not use Truffle for the contract deployment with fee-delegation.

[Sending a transaction with multiple signer](../references/sdk/caver-js-1.4.1/get-started-1.4.1.md#sending-a-transaction-with-multiple-signer) gives a good explanation about two different ways of collecting signatures.
Relevant caver-js APIs are as follows. Take a look at the code examples in the API description.

- [caver.kaia.accounts.signTransaction](../references/sdk/caver-js-1.4.1/api/caver.kaia.accounts.md#signtransaction)
- [caver.kaia.accounts.feePayerSignTransaction](../references/sdk/caver-js-1.4.1/api/caver.kaia.accounts.md#feepayersigntransaction)
- [caver.kaia.accounts.combinesignatures](../references/sdk/caver-js-1.4.1/api/caver.kaia.accounts.md#combinesignatures)
- [caver.kaia.sendSignedTransaction](../references/sdk/caver-js-1.4.1/api/caver.kaia/transaction/transaction.md#sendsignedtransaction)
